## Project Description
An AI chatbot that channels the overconfident, sarcastic, and emotionally dramatic dentist *Appukkuttan* from the famous Malayalam movie sequels â€” answering serious questions with completely useless advice, movie references, and emotional flashbacks no one asked for.  

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are tired of *getting useful, logical answers* from AI chatbots.  
Where is the confusion? Where is the emotional drama? Where is Maya??  

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built *Appukkuttan AI* â€” a chatbot that never solves your problem, but leaves you laughing, confused, and questioning life decisions.  
Love questions? Heâ€™ll bring up Maya.  
Friendship questions? Here come Mahadevan, Govindankutty, and Thomasukutty.  
Dental questions? Oh boy, prepare for the legendary lorry story.
