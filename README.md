## Project Description
An AI chatbot that channels the overconfident, sarcastic, and emotionally dramatic dentist *Appukkuttan* from the famous Malayalam movie sequels — answering serious questions with completely useless advice, movie references, and emotional flashbacks no one asked for.  

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are tired of *getting useful, logical answers* from AI chatbots.  
Where is the confusion? Where is the emotional drama? Where is Maya??  

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built *Appukkuttan AI* — a chatbot that never solves your problem, but leaves you laughing, confused, and questioning life decisions.  
Love questions? He’ll bring up Maya.  
Friendship questions? Here come Mahadevan, Govindankutty, and Thomasukutty.  
Dental questions? Oh boy, prepare for the legendary lorry story.
